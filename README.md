# Hi, I'm Cheruto

I'm looking forward to getting to know you! This document is not intended to replace or override the relationship and mutual understanding we will build as we work together. Its intention is to give you an idea of how I think and how I work.

## TMP Work Preferences according to [TMP framework](https://www.teammanagementsystems.com/tms-profiles/team-managment-profile-tmp/)

Major Role: 
 > Assessor-Developer
Related Roles: 
 > Thruster-Organizer
 > Reporter-Adviser

As an Assessor-Developer I thrive in an environment where I can be creative, I love challenges that require me to analyze situations or data and come up with ideas to solve them. I also recognize that I work with intelligent and talented people, and while I love to share my knowledge, I also use each opportunity to learn from others and collaborate with them.

## My role as a Program Manager

I am here to ensure the successful planning and execution of the ALX learning program(s) and that of the team as a whole. I will strive to ensure that you are well supported in your role so as to deliver a high-quality/performing program.

## My Background as a Program Manager: 

In my previous role as a Program Manager at Andela I led the team to manage the execution of four iterations of Google Africa Developer Scholarship programs in Africa with a total of over 70,000 learners. This program was a pathway to enhancing employability potential at Andela and other Technology-driven organizations globally, read more about the program [here](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6795400660696211456/).

## One-on-ones

I will block 30 minutes with you weekly for our 1:1’s, in these sessions we can have a casual check-in,  talk about your weekly wins/challenges, brainstorm ideas, and talk about growth (I can be a great accountability partner). We will start a 1:1 agenda document for documentation and meeting planning. 

Here are some interesting articles about 1:1;

### Performance

I believe you were hired for your role because you are good at it and I will allow you to have full autonomy with your work, I believe that is how we do our best work. I will ensure we have clear program goals and expectations, and out of that work with you to define your KPIs. You will be responsible for defining your TO-DOs and tracking your performance against them. 

## Ways of Working

Work Hours: 9 AM - 6 PM EAT (I may start work a little earlier or later sometimes) 
Meetings: I prefer afternoon meetings (If possible booked at least one day ahead)
Channels: I am quick to respond on Slack (I prefer to use official work channels to communicate with you as opposed to personal Whatsapp)


### How I like to receive feedback...

I would like to receive feedback from you regularly as well. Feel free to use our 1:1 to give me feedback or team meetings for Program feedback. This will help me ensure I am actioning this feedback regularly instead of during feedback cycles only.

## Things I need…

Great team to work with - I value communication and collaboration, and feedback.

## Conclusion

This document is meant to focus on how I work and what to expect from me. I have never experienced having myself as a manager, If something here seems off please let me know in our one-on-one or over Slack.

This document is meant to focus on how I work and what to expect from me. We will discuss expectations I have of you and the rest of the team soon after we begin working together, and I will link you to an internal onboarding document with some HubSpot-specific onboarding information.
